# * We use a table due to the size of it.
# * Using dns names does not work since firewall comes up before network, thus it cannot
#   resolve hostnames. DCC servers have following host names:

#
# Use following script to re-generate
#
#  for i in `jot 9 1` ; do host dcc$i.dcc-servers.net | awk 'BEGIN { ORS=",\n" } /has address/ { print $4 }' ; done
