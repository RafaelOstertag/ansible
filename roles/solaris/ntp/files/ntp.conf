# To configure NTP servers, replace the server_name with either the IP address
# or hostname of the server you wish to use. If you just want to keep the time
# in a causual way, one server may be enough for you. If you wish to keep it
# to a more accurate level, 3 or more is recommended. Do not choose 2, because
# 2 servers is an unstable configuration. By the same token 3 is only acceptable
# if all are always available, since when a single one reboots or otherwise 
# becomes unavailable, you have just 2.
#
# For a list of Internet NTP servers see 
# http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Servers/WebHome
# If you use this list, be sure to read, understand and abide by the rules
# each server has published for accessing themselves.
#
# There is also a DNS round-robin pool of public access NTP servers. The
# instructions for accessing these are at http://www.pool.ntp.org
# Please consider adding your own servers to the pool if possible.
#
# Many ISP's also provide NTP servers for use by their customers.

# There are several types on authentication supported by NTP. The easiest
# to use is a set of passwords, called "keys". They should be stored
# the /etc/inet/ntp.keys file. Each key in the ntp.keys file can be
# assigned to certain types of trust levels. See ntpd(1m) for more

# To configure leap seconds processing, download the latest NIST leap seconds
# file to /etc/inet, and then create a symbolic link to it from the ntp.leap
# file. Without this file, NTP will still be able to accept leap announcements
# from its upstream sources. If this file exists and is less than 6 months old
# then the contents of this file will take precedence over the upstream servers.
# The latest leap seconds file is always available at ftp://time.nist.gov/pub
